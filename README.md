These practices lean on Test-Driven Development (TDD), but they're not an exact matched concepts.

The following steps assume you are in the same directory as the exercises.

Reference material(s):

- The [Rust language section](https://exercism.io/languages/rust)

### Practices

Run the test suite. It can be run with `cargo`, which is installed with rust automatically.

```
$ cargo test
```
